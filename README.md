# Regime Cluster Trading

A quantitative research pipeline for **market regime detection**
using **PCA + HDBSCAN** clustering.

This project implements an end-to-end workflow:

• Market data ingestion  
• Multi-order statistical feature engineering  
• Dimensionality reduction  
• Density-based regime clustering  
• Robust post-processing utilities

## Motivation

Financial markets exhibit **regime-dependent behavior**:
• trending
• mean-reverting
• high volatility
• crisis periods  

Detecting such hidden regimes improves:

✔ strategy selection  
✔ risk management  
✔ position sizing  
✔ drawdown control
